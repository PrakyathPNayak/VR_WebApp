# VR_WebApp

A secure, real-time VR web application powered by **Go** on the backend and **modern JavaScript** on the frontend. The system supports **end-to-end encrypted streaming**, **WebRTC-based video/audio communication**, **gyroscope motion tracking**, and **hand gesture recognition** using **MediaPipe** — optimized for VR control and remote streaming use cases.

---

## 🌐 Overview

The Go backend acts as the command center, managing:
- Encrypted WebSocket communication
- WebRTC signaling (SDP, ICE)
- RSA-AES key exchange
- Data routing for gyroscope, hand gestures, and control messages

The frontend is modularized for maintainability and handles:
- Stream playback and UI interaction
- MediaPipe-based hand tracking
- Secure encrypted message generation (AES-GCM)
- Motion tracking via device orientation sensors (gyroscope)

This project is especially suitable as a foundation for:
- VR-based remote streaming
- VR robot/telepresence control
- Real-time gesture-based control apps

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **Secure RSA-AES Handshake** via Web Crypto API & JSEncrypt
- 🎥 **Low-latency WebRTC streaming** with real-time signaling over WebSocket
- 📡 **Encrypted sensor data** from gyroscope and hand tracking
- 🧠 **3D Hand landmark tracking** using MediaPipe Tasks
- 🌎 **Multi-peer session support** via room-based design
- 📲 **Mobile-compatible gyro tracking**, permission-managed for iOS/Android
- 🛠️ **Full modular frontend architecture** for easy extensibility

## 🧪 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/PrakyathPNayak/VR_WebApp.git
cd VR_WebApp
```

### 2. Build & Run the Go Backend

```
cd go/
go build -o vrserver
./vrserver
```

> 🔐 Ensure you're serving over `localhost` or HTTPS for Web Crypto API compatibility.

### 3. Serve the Static Frontend

You can use any static file server or your Go backend as an HTTP file server.

For example:

```
cd static/
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Access in the browser:
```
http://localhost:8080/
```

## 💡 Usage

- Click `Start VR` to begin encrypted handshake and VR session.
- Use the **"Pause"**, **"Resume"**, and **"Disconnect"** buttons to control session flow.
- Allow motion tracking + camera access when prompted.
- Use gesture/hand tracking by selecting a camera and clicking “Start Hand Tracking.”
- Stream quality can be adjusted with a slider.
